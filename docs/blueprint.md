## Original User Request:
An web app exactly like Excalidraw (https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw.git), same features, usability, tools and so on to start my own proposal for the app. Then I seek to build a canvas-like using the opensource of excalidraw to transform to a architecture and urban planning design creation space.
